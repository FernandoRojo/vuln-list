 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "If the product implements access-control protection on the debug and test interface, a debugger is typically required to enter either a valid response to a challenge provided by the authorization logic or, alternatively, enter the right password in order to exercise the debug and test interface. However, if this protection mechanism does not exclude all untrusted, debug agents, an attacker could access/control security-sensitive registers."
