 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "A device's internal information may be accessed through a scan chain of interconnected internal registers usually through a JTAG interface. The JTAG interface provides access to these registers in a serial fashion in the form of a scan chain for the purposes of debugging programs running on a device. Since almost all information contained within a device may be accessed over this interface, device manufacturers typically insert some form of authentication and authorization to prevent unintended use of this sensitive information. This mechanism is implemented in addition to on-chip protections that are already present. If this control is not implemented or not implemented properly a user may be able to bypass on-chip protection mechanisms through debug interface."
