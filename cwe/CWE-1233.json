 "ExtendedDescription": [
  "Integrated circuits and hardware IPs can expose the device configuration controls that need to be programmed after device power reset by a trusted firmware or software module (commonly set by BIOS/bootloader) and then locked from any further modification. This is commonly implemented using a trusted lock bit, which when set disables writes to a protected set of registers or address regions. The lock protection is intended to prevent modification of certain system configuration (e.g., memory/memory protection unit configuration). If any system registers/controls that can modify the protected configuration are not write-protected by the lock,  they can then be leveraged by software to modify the protected configuration."
