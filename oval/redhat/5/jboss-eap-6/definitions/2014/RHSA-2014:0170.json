    "Description": "Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6 is a platform for Java\napplications based on JBoss Application Server 7.\n\nIt was found that the ParserPool and Decrypter classes in the OpenSAML Java\nimplementation resolved external entities, permitting XML External Entity\n(XXE) attacks. A remote attacker could use this flaw to read files\naccessible to the user running the application server, and potentially\nperform other more advanced XXE attacks. (CVE-2013-6440)\n\nIt was discovered that the Apache Santuario XML Security for Java project\nallowed Document Type Definitions (DTDs) to be processed when applying\nTransforms even when secure validation was enabled. A remote attacker could\nuse this flaw to exhaust all available memory on the system, causing a\ndenial of service. (CVE-2013-4517)\n\nIn Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform, when running under a\nsecurity manager, it was possible for deployed code to get access to the\nModular Service Container (MSC) service registry without any permission\nchecks. This could allow malicious deployments to modify the internal state\nof the server in various ways. (CVE-2014-0018)\n\nThe CVE-2013-6440 was discovered by David Illsley, Ron Gutierrez of Gotham\nDigital Science, and David Jorm of the Red Hat Security Response Team, and\nthe CVE-2014-0018 issue was discovered by Stuart Douglas of Red Hat.\n\nThis release serves as a replacement for JBoss Enterprise Application\nPlatform 6.2.0, and includes bug fixes and enhancements. Documentation for\nthese changes will be available shortly from the JBoss Enterprise\nApplication Platform 6.2.1 Release Notes, linked to in the References.\n\nAll users of Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform 6.2.0 on Red Hat\nEnterprise Linux 5 are advised to upgrade to these updated packages.\nThe JBoss server process must be restarted for the update to take effect.",
