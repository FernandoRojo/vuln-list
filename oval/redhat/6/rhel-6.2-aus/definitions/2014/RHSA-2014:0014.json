Accordingly, Red Hat\nwill no longer provide updated packages, including critical impact security\npatches or urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2 EUS\nafter that date. In addition, technical support through Red Hat's Global\nSupport Services will no longer be provided after January 7, 2014.\n\nNote: This notification applies only to those customers subscribed to the\nExtended Update Support (EUS) channel for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.2.\n\nWe encourage customers to plan their migration from Red Hat Enterprise\nLinux 6.2 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.
