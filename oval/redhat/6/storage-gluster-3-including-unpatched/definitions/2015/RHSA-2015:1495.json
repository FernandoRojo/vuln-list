    "Description": "Red Hat Gluster Storage is a software only scale-out storage solution that\nprovides flexible and affordable unstructured data storage. It unifies data storage and infrastructure, increases performance, and improves availability and manageability to meet enterprise-level storage challenges.\n\nRed Hat Gluster Storage's Unified File and Object Storage is built on\nOpenStack's Object Storage (swift).\n\nA flaw was found in the metadata constraints in OpenStack Object Storage\n(swift). By adding metadata in several separate calls, a malicious user\ncould bypass the max_meta_count constraint, and store more metadata than\nallowed by the configuration. (CVE-2014-7960)\n\nMultiple flaws were found in check-mk, a plug-in for the Nagios monitoring\nsystem, which is used to provide monitoring and alerts for the Red Hat\nGluster Storage network and infrastructure: a reflected cross-site\nscripting flaw due improper output encoding, a flaw that could allow\nattackers to write .mk files in arbitrary file system locations, and a flaw\nthat could possibly allow remote attackers to execute code in the wato (web\nbased admin) module due to the unsafe use of the pickle() function.\n(CVE-2014-5338, CVE-2014-5339, CVE-2014-5340)\n\nThis update also fixes numerous bugs and adds various enhancements. Space\nprecludes documenting all of these changes in this advisory. Users are\ndirected to the Red Hat Gluster Storage 3.1 Technical Notes, linked to in\nthe References section, for information on the most significant of these\nchanges.\n\nThis advisory introduces the following new features:\n\n* NFS-Ganesha is now supported in highly available active-active\nenvironment. In a highly available active-active environment, if a\nNFS-Ganesha server that is connected to a NFS client running a particular\napplication crashes, the application/NFS client is seamlessly connected to\nanother NFS-Ganesha server without any administrative intervention.\n\n* Snapshot scheduler creates snapshots automatically based on the\nconfigured scheduled interval of time. The snapshots can be created every\nhour, a particular day of the month, particular month, or a particular day\nof the week.\n\n* You can now create a clone of a snapshot. This is a writable clone and\nbehaves like a regular volume. A new volume can be created from a\nparticular snapshot clone. Snapshot Clone is a technology preview feature.\n\n* Red Hat Gluster Storage supports network encryption using TLS/SSL.\nRed Hat Gluster Storage uses TLS/SSL for authentication and authorization,\nin place of the home grown authentication framework used for normal connections.\n\n* BitRot detection is a technique used in Red Hat Gluster Storage to\nidentify the silent corruption of data with no indication from the disk to\nthe storage software layer when the error has occurred. BitRot also helps\nin catching backend tinkering of bricks, where the data is directly\nmanipulated on the bricks without going through FUSE, NFS or any other\naccess protocols.\n\n* Glusterfind is a utility that provides the list of files that are\nmodified between the previous backup session and the current period.\nThis list of files can then be used by any industry standard backup\napplication for backup.\n\n* The Parallel Network File System (pNFS) is part of the NFS v4.1 protocol\nthat allows compute clients to access storage devices directly and in\nparallel. pNFS is a technology preview feature.\n\n* Tiering improves the performance, and the compliance aspects in a Red Hat\nGluster Storage environment. It serves as an enabling technology for other\nenhancements by combining cost-effective or archivally oriented storage for\nthe majority of user data with high-performance storage to absorb the\nmajority of I/O workload. Tiering is a technology preview feature.\n\nAll users of Red Hat Gluster Storage are advised to apply this update.",
