    "Description": "STATEMENT: Red Hat Virtualization includes affected version of nodejs-immer, however the usage does not meet the conditions required to exploit the flaw, therefore the impact is Low.\n\nIn OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) the affected components are behind OpenShift OAuth authentication. This restricts access to the vulnerable nodejs-immer library to authenticated users only, therefore the impact is Low. OSSM 1.1 is out of support scope for Moderate and Low impact vulnerabilities, hence is marked Out Of Support Scope.",
