    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A flaw was found in the Undertow AJP connector. Malicious requests and abrupt connection closes could be triggered by an attacker using query strings with non-RFC compliant characters resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            \n            MITIGATION: The issue can be mitigated by using HTTP/1.1 instead of AJP to proxy to the back-end.",
