    "Description": "In accordance with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux Errata Support Policy, Extended Update Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 will be retired as of March 31, 2017, and support will no longer be provided. Accordingly, Red Hat will no longer provide updated packages, including Critical impact security patches or Urgent priority bug fixes, for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 EUS after March 31, 2017. In addition, technical support through Red Hat's Global Support Services will be limited as described under \"non-current minor releases\" in the Knowledge Base article located at https://access.redhat.com/articles/64664 after this date.\n\nWe encourage customers to migrate from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.1 to a more recent version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. As a benefit of the Red Hat subscription model, customers can use their active subscriptions to entitle any system on any currently supported Red Hat Enterprise Linux release.\n\nDetails of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux life cycle can be found here:\nhttps://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata/",
