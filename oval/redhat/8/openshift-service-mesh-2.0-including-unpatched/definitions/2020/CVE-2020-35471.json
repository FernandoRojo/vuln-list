    "Description": "DOCUMENTATION: A NULL pointer dereference vulnerability was found in Envoy. During the handling of truncated or dropped UDP datagrams, this flaw allows an attacker to specify the length of the packet to be larger than 1500 bytes and cause the envoy proxy process to segfault, resulting in a denial of service. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n            STATEMENT: While OpenShift ServiceMesh (OSSM) does package a vulnerable version of Envoy, it does not implement the UDP proxy in Envoy. Therefore, it has been assessed with a Low impact, Wontfix, and may be addressed in a future release.",
