    "Description": "All versions of `@toast-ui/editor` are vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  There are multiple bypasses to the package's built-in XSS sanitization. This may allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript on a victim's browser.\n\n\n## Recommendation\n\nNo fix for the built-in sanitizer is available. Versions 2.1.0 and later have a `customHTMLSanitizer` option that can be used to override the default sanitizer.",
