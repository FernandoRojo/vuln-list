    "Description": "### Impact\n\nAll users of pysaml2 that use the default `CryptoBackendXmlSec1` backend and need to verify signed SAML documents are impacted. `pysaml2 \u003c= 6.4.1` does not validate the SAML document against an XML schema. This allows invalid XML documents to trick the verification process, by presenting elements with a valid signature inside elements whose content has been malformed. The verification is offloaded to `xmlsec1` and `xmlsec1` will not validate every signature in the given document, but only the first it finds in the given scope.\n\n### Patches\n\nUsers should upgrade to pysaml2 `v6.5.0`.\n\n### Workarounds\n\nNo workaround provided at this point.\n\n### References\n\nNo references provided at this point.\n\n### Credits\n\n- Victor SchoÌˆnfelder Garcia (isits AG International School of IT Security)\n- Juraj Somorovsky (Paderborn University)\n- Vladislav Mladenov (Ruhr University Bochum)\n\n### For more information\n\nIf you have any questions or comments about this advisory:\n* Open an issue in [pysaml2](https://github.com/IdentityPython/pysaml2)\n* Email us at [the incident-response address](mailto:incident-response@idpy.org)",
