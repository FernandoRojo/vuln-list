The vulnerability is due to excessive verbosity in certain log subscriptions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by accessing specific log files on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to obtain sensitive log data, which may include user credentials. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need to have valid credentials at the operator level or higher on the affected device."
