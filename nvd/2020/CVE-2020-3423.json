The vulnerability is due to insufficient restrictions on Lua function calls within the context of user-supplied Lua scripts. An attacker with valid administrative credentials could exploit this vulnerability by submitting a malicious Lua script. When this file is processed, an exploitable buffer overflow condition could occur. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the underlying Linux OS of the affected device."
