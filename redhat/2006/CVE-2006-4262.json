    "Multiple buffer overflows in cscope 15.5 and earlier allow user-assisted attackers to cause a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via multiple vectors including (1) a long pathname that is not properly handled during file list parsing, (2) long pathnames that result from path variable expansion such as tilde expansion for the HOME environment variable, and (3) a long -f (aka reffile) command line argument."
