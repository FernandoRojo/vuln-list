  "statement": "This issue can generally only be exploited by x86 HVM guests, as these are the only type of VM which have a QEMU stubdomain. x86 PV and PVH domains, as well as ARM guests typically don't use a stubdomain. Additionally, VMs using PV stubdomains or with emulators running in dom0 cannot exploit the vulnerability.\nXen 4.14 and later versions are vulnerable to this flaw. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 is not affected, as it shipped an older version of Xen which did not include the buggy code path.",

    "A security flaw was found in Xen. This flaw allows a buggy or malicious HVM subdomain to cause an RCU reference to be leaked. This issue causes subsequent administration operations on the host to livelock, resulting in a denial of service (DoS). The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
