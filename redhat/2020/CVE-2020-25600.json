  "mitigation": "There is no known workaround for x86 32-bit Domain 0. The issue can be avoided by reducing the number of event channels available to the guest to no more than 1023.  For example, setting `max_event_channels=1023` in the xl domain configuration, or deleting any existing setting (since 1023 is the default for xl/libxl).",
