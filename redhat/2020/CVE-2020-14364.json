    "An out-of-bounds read/write access flaw was found in the USB emulator of the QEMU in versions before 5.2.0. This issue occurs while processing USB packets from a guest when USBDevice 'setup_len' exceeds its 'data_buf[4096]' in the do_token_in, do_token_out routines. This flaw allows a guest user to crash the QEMU process, resulting in a denial of service, or the potential execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the QEMU process on the host.",
