  "details": [
    "A flaw was found in Xen. Code paths in Xen's MSI handling have been identified which act on unsanitized values read back from device hardware registers. A guest that is not fully trusted may be able to crash Xen, leading to a denial of service (DoS) for the entire system. Privilege escalation and information leaks cannot be excluded. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability."
