  "statement": "The kubeconfig file on the node is that of the bootstrap certificate. This means that to successfully exploit this vulnerability the kubeconfig file must be taken and used within the first 24h of creation as it's originally created with a short expiry. Otherwise attempting to use the credentials after this time will result in:\n`Failed while requesting a signed certificate from the master: cannot create certificate signing request: Unauthorized`\nFurther if taken, the certificate signing request (CSR) of the joining rogue OpenShift node is not automatically approved by default. The node still needs to be approved through the use of the commands `oc get csr` and `oc adm certificate approve`.",
