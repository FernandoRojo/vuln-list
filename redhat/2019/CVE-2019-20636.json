    "In the Linux kernel before 5.4.12, drivers/input/input.c has out-of-bounds writes via a crafted keycode table, as demonstrated by input_set_keycode, aka CID-cb222aed03d7.",
    "An out-of-bounds write flaw was found in the Linux kernel. A crafted keycode table could be used by drivers/input/input.c to perform the out-of-bounds write. A local user with root access can insert garbage to this keycode table that can lead to out-of-bounds memory access. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability."
