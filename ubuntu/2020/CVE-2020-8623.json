  "Description": "If BIND is built with \"--enable-native-pkcs11\" then a specially crafted query for a zone signed with RSA can trigger an assertion failure.  An attacker that can reach a vulnerable system with a specially crafted query packet can trigger a crash.  To be vulnerable, the system must either be running BIND that was built with \"--enable-native-pkcs11\", be signing one or more zones with an RSA key or be able to receive queries from a possible attacker.",
